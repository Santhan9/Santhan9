            <h3>Gigamon</h3>
            <p>This project was a Java-based dashboard application for deep observability,it uses Angular
               as the frontend framework and Java as the backend language. The backend was built 
               using the Spring framework and exposed a RESTful API for communication with the frontend. 
               The system used MongoDB as the database and utilized the Spring Data MongoDB library for 
               easy integration with the Java backend. We implemented security 
              measures such as JWT authentication to protect the API and ensure data integrity.</p>

            <h3>Walgreens</h3>
            <p>This project involved the development of a microservices architecture using 
              Java and the Spring framework. The system was composed of several loosely 
              coupled services, each responsible for specific functionality. The services 
              communicated with each other using RESTful APIs and utilized a message-based 
              system Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication. We used Spring Boot to easily 
              stand up the services and Spring Cloud and Config Server to handle service 
              discovery and configuration 
              management. Additionally, we implemented security measures such as OAuth2 and 
              User Authorization to protect the APIs and ensure data integrity. We also used Azure services
               for easy deployment and scalability.

            <h3>Liberty</h3>
            <p>This project involved the development of a suite of JUnit tests for a Java 
              application. The tests were written using the JUnit framework and covered 
              various aspects of the application including functional and non-functional 
              requirements such as unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing. 
              We also used libraries such as Mockito and PowerMock for mocking and testing 
              complex dependencies. Additionally, we implemented test automation using a 
              Continuous Integration tool such as Jenkins to run the tests on each code commit 
              and generate test reports.
